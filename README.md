# Bou AI Assistant · 1.8.0

Bou is a Windows desktop assistant with local conversation memory and an optional hosted service. Provider API keys stay on the service server; customers connect with individual access tokens.

## Components

- `bou_studio.py`: Bou desktop interface.
- `bou_core.py` and `bou_gui.py`: Bou voice engine and the simpler standalone interface.
- `studio_engine.py` and `studio_store.py`: local assistant, worker manager, memory, and hosted-service client.
- `service/`: FastAPI service and owner admin panel.
- `service/static/admin.html`: configure agent roles and key pairs, create or revoke customer accounts.

## Desktop dashboard

The 1.5.0 desktop screen uses a three-column layout inspired by the publicly visible Stonic product: a signal feed, Bou's animated character core and Agent Town, and the chat inspector. The feed reads public BBC World RSS headlines and links each headline to its BBC page. Search opens a browser results page; it does not give the AI an unrestricted web browser. The 2D/3D control changes a local activity illustration, not a live geographic map. Bou does not request GPS. Gesture toggles the character's idle animation; it is not camera-based gesture recognition.

The layout and original Bou artwork are implemented in this project. Bou 1.6.0 added one-frame camera description and user-approved, one-action-at-a-time PC control. Bou 1.7.0 adds a spoken startup greeting and a configurable live microphone conversation; camera capture is still one-shot, and screen monitoring is not continuous. Other Stonic release features not included in Bou include phone calls, floating characters/live wallpaper, custom character personas, reminders, PDF/document attachments, full-page generated visuals, and web research inside AI answers.

## Hosted service setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` on the server. Set a long random `BOU_ADMIN_TOKEN` and generate `BOU_MASTER_KEY` with:

   ```powershell
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

2. Keep `.env` and a backup of `BOU_MASTER_KEY` private. Losing the master key makes stored provider keys unreadable.
3. Start the service with `docker compose up --build`.
4. Open `/admin`, enter the admin token, configure two OpenRouter key slots for the Manager and each worker, then create a customer account.
5. In the customer's Bou app, choose **service** mode and enter the HTTPS service URL and customer access token.

Each agent tries its second key when the first is rejected or reaches an OpenRouter limit (HTTP 401, 402, 403, or 429). Keys are encrypted at rest and never returned by the admin API. Customer tokens are stored as hashes and can be disabled or revoked. The hosted service does not save chat transcripts; the desktop app keeps its archive locally and sends only context enabled by the user.

For internet-facing use, place the service behind HTTPS and use persistent server storage for `service/data`. The included Compose file binds to localhost for a reverse proxy; it does not configure a public domain, TLS, billing, or a production database.

## Local mode

Run `Start-Bou.bat` on Windows. Local mode uses the existing OpenRouter key from the local installation. The launcher installs the optional OpenCV camera package if it is missing. Worker roles and manager instructions can be edited in Bou. The hosted admin key pool is used only when the app is set to service mode.

## Camera, microphone, and PC control

The Camera & PC page keeps camera access off until the user clicks **Capture one frame** and confirms. Bou captures one still, turns the camera off, previews the image, and sends it to the configured provider only after a second approval. The camera prompt asks for visible, non-sensitive details and does not identify the person. The image stays in memory and is not written to disk.

Bou speaks a welcome when it opens, then starts a live microphone session by default if enabled in Settings. Speak naturally; when a phrase ends, Bou transcribes it, displays the words in chat, sends the text to the configured AI provider, and speaks the answer. The **Mic** button pauses or resumes listening. Raw microphone audio is not saved by Bou.

Wispr Flow Voice Interface API is the default transcription provider. It requires approved Wispr API access and a key; usage may be billed. Save the key through Settings to the current session or Windows Credential Manager. Without a key, Bou will still greet you but will not send microphone audio to another service. Google Speech Recognition is an optional provider that sends audio to Google; Bou does not silently fall back to it.

PC control is off by default and enabled only for the current session. Before every AI planning call, Bou shows the screenshot and asks before sharing it with the configured provider. It then displays one proposed click, key, scroll, or text entry and waits for approval. After executing at most that one action, it stops until the user requests another screenshot. Screenshots and PC-task details are not added to the conversation archive. Passwords, one-time codes, payments, purchases, sending/publishing, deletions, installs, agreements, and security-setting changes are blocked for the user to handle directly.

## Changelog

### 1.8.0 — Bou identity cleanup

- Renamed the legacy assistant's source files and branding to Bou and removed developer attribution.
- Bou no longer invents a developer or owner name when asked; an optional user name can be configured with `BOU_USER_NAME` for meeting mode.
- Moved the local chat archive to the BouStudio data folder without discarding the existing archive.

### 1.7.0 — Live voice conversation and Wispr Flow API

- Added a spoken startup greeting, controlled by the **Speak AI replies and startup greeting** setting.
- Added automatic live microphone startup by default, with a global **Mic** button to pause and resume.
- Added phrase-end voice detection, transcription, automatic chat submission, and spoken AI replies; no Record or Send click is required.
- Added the official Wispr Flow Voice Interface API transcription adapter and secure API key storage through Windows Credential Manager.
- Kept Google Speech Recognition as an explicit alternative; without a Wispr key, audio is not silently sent to another transcription service.

### 1.6.0 — Camera and confirmed PC control

- Added a one-shot camera capture with a local preview and separate approval before sending the frame for a non-sensitive visual description.
- Added a Camera & PC page, session-only PC-control toggle, screenshot-sharing approval, and one proposed action per review/approval cycle.
- Added bounded click, typing, key, and scroll actions; Bou stops after one action and waits for the user before capturing another screen.
- Kept microphone use manual, limited to 12 seconds, with transcript review; camera frames and desktop screenshots are not saved.
- Added OpenCV bootstrap for the optional camera feature and updated the hosted image endpoint to distinguish camera, desktop-control, and ordinary image requests.

### 1.5.0 — Stonic-inspired desktop dashboard

- Reworked the Assistant screen into a signal feed, animated character core, Agent Town, and Voice/Agent/Notes chat inspector.
- Added public BBC World RSS headlines, explicit browser search, task alerts, and local activity-map views with a 2D/3D illustration toggle.
- Added hide/show controls for the feed and chat panels, live Manager/worker status in Agent Town, and a character-animation toggle.
- Kept Bou's own branding and artwork. The activity map uses no location data; gesture control does not access a camera.

### 1.4.0 — Hosted service and administration

- Added the hosted Bou API and owner admin panel.
- Added encrypted server-side key storage with two fallback keys for the Manager and every worker.
- Added manager-led task assignment, parallel worker calls, and final synthesis on the hosted path.
- Added customer token creation, disable, and revoke controls; added service connection settings to the desktop app.
- Added Docker setup and deployment configuration examples. Secrets and local databases are excluded from Git.

### 1.3.0 — Worker manager and dashboard

- Added Manager, Analyst, Planner, and Reviewer roles. The Manager assigns separate subtasks, workers run in parallel, and Bou combines their reports.
- Added Auto, Always, and Off worker modes, editable local worker instructions, and progress indicators.
- Redesigned the assistant view with a session globe, particle character, module controls, Visual Hub, and chat panel.

### 1.2.0 — Conversation memory

- Kept the complete chat archive on the user's PC and added relevant-history retrieval for chat requests.
- Added memory controls, saved notes, and clearer activity reporting.

### 1.1.0 — Studio interface

- Added the desktop studio pages for chat, voice, memory, activity, and settings.
- Added image review before analysis and explicit stop/cancel behavior.
